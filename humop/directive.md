## The Human Optimization System


HUMOP uses technology to leverage our current knowledge of mental health and functioning to delivery personalized care and health optimization. Currently existing knowledge of neuroendocrinology, clinical psychology, and holistic health is within our grasps as abstract knowledge, but combined with machine learning and technology we can make these domains functional on a day to day basis. What does this mean? For example, current clinical psychology is expensive and usually takes the form of hourly weekly sessions, however human cognition takes in information best, aka we change our behaviours best, when information is repeated to us on a daily basis in small chunks. This is known as habit forming. Current psychological services are overwhelmed and ineffecient to produce behavioural change in their clients, and modern clinical psychology that revolves around mindfulness and action-based mental health (away from psychotherapy) has not found a good delivery system aside from apps. HUMOP is meant to make your health choices on a day to day basis implicitely built into your routine, so that you don't have to actively force yourself to gain the motivation to or wait long periods between therapy sessions. In this goal we hope to have happier, healthier, and
