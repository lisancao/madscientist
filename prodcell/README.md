# Procedural generation of cellular systems

Taking inspiration from video games and computer vision, can we train models on cellular 3D matrices tagged with biological metadata (sequencing data for instance) to generate highly detailed organ representations?

Procedural generation because I wonder if at a certain point we can just continuously generate animal models and humans (notwithstanding hardware limitations).
