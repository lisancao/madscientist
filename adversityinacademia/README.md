Podcast/Book idea where different academics come on (anonymous or not) and discuss some of the adversities they've faced in their careers. 


Note: This actually is a very sane idea but it's become abandoned since I started it in (2016/17?). I just had a hard time finding academics who were willing to get into the nitty gritties of their lives on a public platform (who knew?)
