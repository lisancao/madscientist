# Random science ideas 
### Repository for my completely unbased ideas and abandoned pet projects. Also known as "crack science" or "mad science" because some of these are straight out of science fiction.

#### Note: I cringe at myself and some of these ideas a lot, but I'm happy to engage in discussion about them and potential directions/feasibility, or even just shoot the shit about how absurd some of these are. If you want to start a thread, feel free to do so in the [discussions](https://github.com/lisancao/madscientist/discussions) tab. No formalities needed.
