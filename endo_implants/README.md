Could a pseudo organic medium or electronic implant be developed that would allow scientists to discretely and continuously measure hormone and neurotransmitter levels? 

- ELISAs are currently the best way to measure levels, using animal antibodies, but what if we can create some sort of organic medium that had could mimic receptor mechanisms and through some sort of nano engineering, such that we could get real time information on certain hormone levels (e.g some mouth implant that records real time cortisol levels through saliva)
